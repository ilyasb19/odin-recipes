			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>A recipe from my home in Emilia-Romagna, Italy. This lasagne verde made with spinach<br> pasta cannot be beaten. It's excellent if you want to impress some guests — or even yourself.<br> It may be a bit time-consuming, but it's well worth the TLC you put into it.</p>
			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>5 ounces spinach - rinsed, stemmed, and dried</li>
				<li>⅝ cup semolina flour</li>
				<li>2 large eggs</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
				<li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour<li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Stepa</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Make pasta: Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add spinach, cover, and steam until bright green, about 2 minutes. Squeeze spinach to remove excess moisture and process in a food processor to make a paste. Add semolina, eggs, and salt; process until smooth. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in enough flour to make a smooth dough. Knead briefly, then cover with a dish towel and set aside.</li>
				<li>Make ragu: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Cook and stir carrot, celery, onion, and bacon in hot butter until onion is translucent. Stir in pork, beef, and ham; cook and stir until crumbly and browned. Stir in beef stock, tomato paste, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
				<li>While ragu is simmering, make béchamel: Combine butter and flour in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk to make a roux. Remove from heat, let rest for 1 minute, then whisk in warm milk. Return to heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until thickened. Season with salt and nutmeg. Remove from heat.</li>
				<li>Cook pasta: Prepare an ice bath. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. On a floured surface, divide pasta dough into 3 portions. Roll each portion out to a thin sheet. Cook each pasta sheet in boiling water for 3 minutes; remove and dip in ice water; drain and dry on a clean cloth.</li>
